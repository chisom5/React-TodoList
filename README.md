# React Todo-List

This is my first react application, after learning the basis in react.

## To run this project

* you have to have node install on your laptop

* git clone the repo.

* then run npm install to install the dependencies in the package.json file

* finally type "npm start" to launch the program since it is using webpack sever.

* so the application will be serve on a localhost port 3000.
